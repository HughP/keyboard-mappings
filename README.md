wide-layout is my reference wide layout for pictorial purposes.

wide-layout-comparision is that same wide layout, but more triggers more accurate keypresses in the KLA engine.  (For example, because the engine overestimates use of number row symbols, wide-layout-comparision removes those symbols entirely, forcing the AltGr symbols to be used.)

In general, the -comparison layouts are those layouts for testing, while the other layouts are pictorial.
